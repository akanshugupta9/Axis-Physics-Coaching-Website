				<h2>Batch: Foundation</h2>
				<hr>
				<h4><u>Duration</u></h4>
				<p>1 year.</p>
				<h4><u>Eligibility</u></h4>
				<p>Class X to XI Moving Students</p>
				<h4><u>Course Description</u></h4>
				<p>The best brains compete to get an admission to this two-year legendary course offered by us. The course, unmatched in its rigour and precision, raises you to the very zenith of your preparation. The stimulating atmosphere of the institute, small batches (yes-we believe in quality) and one to one interaction with the instructor ensure that every rough edge is smoothened, every small doubt is cleared, that's why most of our toppers are from this course. More importantly, we train you to think analytically, we give you a systematic approach to problem solving - a must for IIT-JEE. If you think you are bright, if you think you are capable, if you think that you can make it to the top, this course is precisely for you.</p>
				<h4><u>Admission Process</u></h4>
				<p>Through BOOST (Bansal Open Opportunity and Scholarship Test) to be held on 25 Sep 2016, 16 Oct 2016, 20 Nov 2016, 18 Dec 2016, 15 Jan 2017, 05 Feb 2017 and 26 Mar 2017.. The test will be objective and syllabus is Science and Maths of Class IX and X Board. Applications are invited along with attested photocopy of Class IX mark sheet from 1nd week of Oct 2016.</p>
